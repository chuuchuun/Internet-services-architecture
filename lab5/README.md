This lab focuses on building a web application using the Angular Framework to interact with the previously developed microservices gateway. 
Tasks include creating views for listing, adding, editing, and viewing details of categories and elements, leveraging Angular's routing module. 
The application implements dynamic path parameters for seamless navigation and CRUD operations, ensuring an intuitive user interface for managing categories and their associated elements.
