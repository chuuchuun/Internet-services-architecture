This project focuses on developing a Java SE application to explore fundamental programming concepts such as object relationships (1:N), entity classes, and the builder pattern. 
Key features include using Stream API for collection operations, serialization for data persistence, and multi-threading with custom thread pools. 
The application is built as an Apache Maven project, with Project Lombok support.
