This project introduces the Spring Framework and Spring Boot, focusing on dependency injection, inversion of control, and Spring Data for database interactions. 
Tasks include enhancing JPA-annotated entity classes, implementing repositories and services, initializing example data, and creating a command-line interface for basic CRUD operations. 
The application is built as a Maven Spring Boot project, using H2 as the in-memory database.
