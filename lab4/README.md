This lab introduces microservices architecture by decomposing a monolithic Spring Boot application into two standalone services: one for category management and another for elements management. 
Tasks include implementing inter-application event-based communication using REST and creating a Spring Cloud Gateway application for centralized routing. 
Each service uses its private in-memory H2 database while maintaining consistency through event synchronization.
